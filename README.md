## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With the development of this project, I used react-router-dom for the first time, which makes me feel great as I have laid the foundations for mastering it. With each project, new challenges arise, and with each one of them, we must push ourselves to become better programmers.

### Continued development

I intend to continue developing my skills in JavaScript and React through the creation of more complex projects, making my knowledge increasingly useful, and ultimately securing my first job as a programmer.
